# PYTHON FOR EVERYBODY
# CHAPTER ONE EXCERCISES 

Exercise 1: What is the function of the secondary memory in a com-
puter?

ANS: Store information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle

Exercise 2: What is a program?
A program is a series of instructions written in a particular programming language
that performs an action.

Exercise 3: What is the difference between a compiler and an inter-
preter?

A compiler needs to be handed the entire program in a file, and then it runs a Process to translate the high-level source code into machine language and then the compiler puts the resulting machine language
into a file for later execution.

An interpreter  reads the source code of the progam as it is written by the programmer, parses the source code and interprets the instructions on the fly. 
python is an interpreter and when we are running Python interactively, we can type a line of Python (a sentence)
and Python processes it immediately and is ready for us to type another line of Python.

Exercise 4: Which of the following contains “machine code”?

Ans: Python source file

Exercise 5: What is wrong with the following code
 primt 'Hello world!'
File "<stdin>", line 1
primt 'Hello world!'

Ans: Syntax Error 

Exercise 6: Where in the computer is a variable such as “x” stored after
the following Python line finishes?

x = 123
a) Central processing unit
b) Main Memory
c) Secondary Memory
d) Input Devices
e) Output Devices

Ans: Main Memory

Exercise 7: What will the following program print out:
x = 43
x = x - 1
print(x)
a) 43
b) 42
c) x + 1
d) Error because x = x + 1 is not possible mathematically

Ans: 42

Exercise 8: Explain each of the following using an example of a hu-
man capability: 
(1) Central processing unit, (2) Main Memory, (3)
Secondary Memory, (4) Input Device, and (5) Output Device. For ex-
ample, “What is the human equivalent to a Central Processing Unit”?

Centeral Processing Unit is the heart of the computer 

The Central Processing Unit (or CPU) is the part of the computer that is
built to be obsessed with “what is next?” If your computer is rated at 3.0
Gigahertz, it means that the CPU will ask “What next?” three billion times
per second. You are going to have to learn how to talk fast to keep up with
the CPU.

The Main Memory is the brain of the computer
The Main Memory is used to store information that the CPU needs in a
hurry. The main memory is nearly as fast as the CPU. But the information
stored in the main memory vanishes when the computer is turned off.

The Secondary Memory is also used to store information, but it is much
slower than the main memory. The advantage of the secondary memory is
that it can store information even when there is no power to the computer.
Examples of secondary memory are disk drives or flash memory (typically
found in USB sticks and portable music players).

The Input and Output Devices are simply our screen, keyboard, mouse, mi-
crophone, speaker, touchpad, etc. They are all of the ways we interact with
the computer.

These days, most computers also have a Network Connection to retrieve
information over a network. We can think of the network as a very slow
place to store and retrieve data that might not always be “up”. So in a sense,
the network is a slower and at times unreliable form of Secondary Memory



Exercise 9: How do you fix a “Syntax Error”?
Ans: By updating the code with the correct syntax
