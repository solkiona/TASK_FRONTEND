print("Hello " + name)



# Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per

# Enter Hours: 35
# Enter Rate: 2.75
# Pay: 96.25

Hours = input("Enter Hours: ")
Rate = input("Enter Rate: ")
print("Pay:",  Hours * Rate)


# Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment state-
# ments:

width = 17
height = 12.0

# # For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the
# # type (of the value of the expression).

print((width//2), type((width//2)))
print(width/2.0, type(width/2.0))
print(height/3, type(height/3))
print( 1 + 2 * 5, type(1 + 2 * 5)) 

# Ans:
8 <class 'int'>
8.5 <class 'float'>
4.0 <class 'float'>
11 <class 'int'>

# Exercise 5: Write a program which prompts the user for a Celsius tem-
# perature, convert the temperature to Fahrenheit, and print out the
# converted temperature.

temperature = input("Enter value for the temperature in celcius: \n")

tempFahren = (temperature * (9/5) ) + 32

print(tempFahren)
